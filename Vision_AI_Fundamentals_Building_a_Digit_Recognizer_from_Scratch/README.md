# Vision AI Fundamentals ‚Äì Digit Recognizer from Scratch

A complete project demonstrating how to build a digit recognition model from the ground up using deep learning fundamentals. This project walks through data preparation, model architecture, training, evaluation, and deployment concepts for handwritten digit recognition (e.g. MNIST-style).

## üöÄ Project Workflow

Here‚Äôs the typical workflow followed in this project:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data Preparation** | Load the dataset (handwritten digit images), normalize / scale pixel values, and split into training, validation, and test sets. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Visualize sample digits, label distributions, and inspect any anomalies or class imbalance. |
| **Model Definition** | Build a neural network from scratch: one or more hidden layers, choice of activation functions, etc. |
| **Training & Validation** | Configure training: loss function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size. Use callbacks / early stopping where applicable. |
| **Evaluation** | Measure performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, possibly other metrics (precision, recall) on the test set. Visualize misclassified samples. |
| **Saving & Inference** | Save the trained model, and provide a script / notebook to run inference on new images. |

## ‚öô Model & Architecture

- Input: images of handwritten digits (e.g., 28√ó28 grayscale images)
- Hidden layers: [details about number of layers, units per layer, activation functions]
- Output: softmax over 10 classes (digits 0‚Äì9)
- Loss function: cross-entropy
- Optimizer: e.g. SGD / Adam
- Regularization: (dropout, weight decay, etc., if used)

## üìà Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Training Accuracy | ‚Ä¶ |
| Validation Accuracy | ‚Ä¶ |
| Test Accuracy | ‚Ä¶ |
| Other observations | ‚Ä¶ e.g. overfitting, class imbalance, etc. |

(You can include plots: loss & accuracy curves, confusion matrix, sample wrong predictions.)

## üìÇ Usage

To train the model from scratch:

```bash
python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 0.001
```

To run inference on a new image:

```bash
python src/inference.py --image_path path/to/image.png
```

## üß™ Dependencies

Here are the main libraries used:

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- (Any others, e.g. PIL, OpenCV if used)

Check `requirements.txt` for full list.

## ‚ö† Notes

- Ensure GPU availability if training large models or using many epochs.  
- Preprocessing steps (normalization / scaling) should match at train & inference time.  
- If results vary a lot, try fixing random seeds for reproducibility.
